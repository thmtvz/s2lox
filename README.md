# s2lox (started life as lox)

s2lox is a small toy language based on [the lox language](https://craftinginterpreters.com) with some 
flavour of mine on top of it.


Currently on development.

## Getting it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thmtvz/s2lox && cd s2lox
make java
./build/jS2lox resources/examples/hello.lx #ðŸ˜„
```

## Examples

- The most important program ever:
```
print "Hello, world!"; //Hello, world!
```

- Recursive fibonacci:
```
fun fib(n){
	if(n < 2) return n;
	return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}

var startTime = clock();
var result = fib(12);
var endTime = clock();

print toString(endTime - startTime) + " was the time needed to compute fib(12)"; //0.(0)* was the time...
```
